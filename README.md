## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
This project follows the CRISP-DM process 

For this project, I was aiming to build a ML model to correctly predict user response to offers from starbucks.
The dataset used is a simulated one 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook(Starbucks_Capstone_notebook) and a data folder with the data used to get to the results  here to showcase work related to the above questions.  . Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
